## Windows Commands üìú
#### powershell: This command starts up the PowerShell command line/script interpreter. Use this if you are more comfortable working with Linux/Bash-like commands rather than Command Prompt's commands. Not all Windows machines support this command.
```
powershell
```

## Enumeration üåê

### Network Enumeration

#### Ping: Does an ICMP echo to target IP to checks if target is up. Also provides TTL (Time to live) info, revealing OS information.
```
ping <target_ip>
```
##### -=TTL=-
ttl 64 = Linux, ttl 128 = Windows, ttl 255 = Network device

#### nmap: Network mapper. Can be used to enumerate a target's ports and much more. By default, it scans the top 1000 most common ports.
```
nmap <target_ip>
``` 
##### -=Flags=-
-sV = Service Scan,
-sS = SYN Scan,
-sA = ACK Scan,
-sT = TCP Scan,
-sU = UDP Scan (some services run on UDP connections),
-sC = Run Default Scripts,
-Pn = Don't send ping probes,
-p = Port (-p- scans all ports),
-T = Speed, 1-5 with 5 being the fastest (3 is default),
-F = Top 100 ports,
--source-port <port> = Send requests from this port (some firewalls block all traffic except for whitelisted ports, try port 53),
--script <name/category> = Execute a specific script or scripts from a certain category

### Port Enumeration

#### Port 21: FTP
FTP or File Transfer Protocol is commonly hosted on port 21. It allows the transfer of computer files following a client to server model.
```
ftp <target IP>
```
##### -=Anonymous Login=-
You may login to ftp using a guest account without a password under the username anonymous. anonymous:NONE

##### -=Commands=-
get = (Used to download specified file), put = (Used to upload specified file)
```
ftp> get <filename>
```
```
ftp> put <filename>
```

#### Port 22: SSH
SSH or Secure Shell is a service that provides the ability to remotely login to a computer and securely send commands. Meaning, that this service can be used in public networks.
```
ssh <username@target IP>
```
##### -=Flags=-
-i = Identity File (used to authenticate a user without a password given a private key (for example id_RSA), make sure to chmod 600 the id_rsa file (or whatever it's named) or ssh will not accept it)
```
ssh <username@target IP> -i <filename>
```
##### PuTTYgen
To connect to an openSSH session using a PuTTYgen generated private key, you must export the PuTTYgen private key to the openSSH private key file format.
```
puttygen <keyfile> -O private-openssh -o <id_rsa/keyfile name>
```

#### Port 23: Telnet
Like SSH, Telnet is a service that provides the ability to send commands to a remote computer. However, unlike SSH, Telnet sends commands in plaintext. Therefore, Telnet should only be used in private networks.
```
telnet <target IP> <optional, port>
```
```
telnet -l <username> <target IP> <optional, port>
```
##### -=Flags=-
-l = User (username of the user you wish to login as)

#### Port 25: SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
SMTP, or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is an internet mail protocol used to send and retrieve electronic mail. 
There are various ways to connect to SMTP, with telnet being one of them.
```
telnet <target IP> 25
EHLO ALL
VRFY <username>
```
#### Port 53: DNS
DNS, also known as Domain Name System is a service that allows for the querying of domain names. DNS servers runs on this port, while also sending replies to clients on the same port. Therefore, the client needs to have port 53 open in order to query and receive information from a DNS server. Through port 53, queries about domain names are transmitted and received. Additionally, DNS servers use port 53 for zone transfers through TCP and more.
```
dig any <domain name> @<target ip>
```
```
dig TXT <domain name> @<target ip>
```
```
dig axfr <domain name> @<target ip>
```
#### -=Options=-
any = (lists A=IPv4, AAAA=IPv6, TXT record, NS = name server, SOA = State of Authority record and zone information, etc), TXT = Text Record (A text record for various uses), axfr = Asynchronous Full Zone Transfer (lists out related hosts/subdomains/files in Master/Slave system)

#### Ports 80, 8080, 443: HTTP/S
HTTP and HTTPS stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is used to load web pages, such as HTML documents onto a browser. In other words, HTTP and HTTPS is used for loading up websites onto the internet to view through a browser client.

To access a website, you can simply put the domain name or IP address into a web browser's URL field.
```
<domain name/IP>
```
```
<domain name/IP>:<port>
```

#### Port 6379: Redis
Redis is an open-source in-memory type database. Due to it being in-memory, it is faster than a traditional database. It uses a key-value system.
```
redis-cli -h <target IP>
```
##### -=Commands=-
info = Information (lists information about the database such as version, number of keys, etc.), keys * = Keys All (lists all the keys in the database), get = Get (get the content for a specified key), select = Select (selects the database)
```
<IP of Target>:6379> info
```
```
<IP of Target>:6379> keys *
```
```
<IP of Target>:6379> get <key name (not number)>
```
```
<IP of Target>:6379> select <database number/name>
```
##### -=Additional Comments=-
If you don't have the redis-cli command, then you need to install redis-tools. This can be done as so on Linux:
```
sudo apt install redis-tools
```

WRITE STUFF HERE ABOUT OBJDUMP, STRINGS, ASSEMBLY, GHIDRA

## Miscellaneous üõ†Ô∏è
### JavaScript and Node.JS
#### Read Local Files
```
require('fs').readFileSync('</path>');
```
##### -=Convert Output To String=-
```
require('fs').readFileSync('</path>').toString();
```
```
new String(require('fs').readFileSync('</path>'));
```

### Git and GitHub
#### How to Initialize and Forward Local Repository to GitHub
To initiate a GitHub repository, login to the website and create a new repository. Then, to initialize your local repository and forward it to your GitHub repository, you can do the following:
```
git init
```
-----
```
git add <filename, . to add all>
```
OR
```
git add .
```
-----
```
git commit -m "Commit message here for logs"
```
```
git branch -M main
```
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/some-repository.git
```
```
git push -u origin main
```
##### -=Options=-
init = Initialize (initializes/creates a git repository in the current working directory as .git hidden file), add = Add (adds a specified file/directory, or using . adds every file in current directory, to the staging area where it is being prepared to commit... note that only staged files will be pushed to the updated repository on commit), commit = Commit (commits and finalizes a repository update on local repository, usually with a commit message), branch = Branch (used for various commands that relate to branches, such as switching, adding, deleting, etc.), remote = Remote (used to interact with a remote repository, usually on GitHub), push = Push (pushes the currently selected branch's local repository to some main repository, usually a GitHub online repository), status = Status (will display information regarding files in the staging area, files that have been changed and not added to the staging area, or if nothing has changed, then the directory is described as clean), log = Log (displays a chronological commit history for the repository), diff = Difference (displays the differences between various things like files, directories, branches, and more)
```
git log
```
```
git diff <optional> <optional>
```
```
git status
```
